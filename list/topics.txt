Changing, Adding, and Removing Elements

motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles)
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']

motorcycles[0] = 'ducati'
print(motorcycles)
['ducati', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']

Appending Elements to the End of a List

Inserting Elements into a List
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati')
print(motorcycles)

['ducati', 'honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']

Removing an Item Using the del Statement
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
del motorcycles[0]

['yamaha', 'suzuki']

Removing an Item Using the pop() Method
The pop() method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work
with that item after removing it.

motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles)
popped_motorcycle = motorcycles.pop()
print(motorcycles)
print(popped_motorcycle)

Popping Items from any Position in a List
You can actually use pop() to remove an item in a list at any position by
including the index of the item you want to remove in parentheses.
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
u first_owned = motorcycles.pop(0)

Removing an Item by Value
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']
print(motorcycles)
u motorcycles.remove('ducati')
print(motorcycles)

Sorting a List Permanently with the sort() Method
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
cars.sort()
print(cars)
['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']

cars.sort(reverse=True)
print(cars)
['toyota', 'subaru', 'bmw', 'audi']

Sorting a List Temporarily with the sorted() Function

print("Here is the original list:")
print(cars)
print("\nHere is the sorted list:")
print(sorted(cars))

Printing a List in Reverse Order
cars.reverse()
print(cars)

Using range() to Make a List of Numbers
numbers = list(range(1,6))

Nested Lists

asia = [["India", "Japan", "Korea"], ["Srilanka", "Myanmar", "Thailand"], ["Cambodia", "Vietnam", "Israel"]]

The del Statement
a = [5, -8, 99.99, 432, 108, 213]
del a[0]

The methods for a list are:

append
count
extend
insert
pop
remove
reverse
sort

• Lists are a basic and useful data structure built into the Python language.
• Built-in functions include len(), which returns the length of the list; max(),
    which returns the maximum element in the list; min(), which returns the minimum
    element in the list and sum(), which returns the sum of all the elements
    in the list.
• An individual elements in the list can be accessed using the index operator [].
• Lists are mutable sequences which can be used to add, delete, sort and even reverse
    list elements.
• The sort() method is used to sort items in the list.
• The split() method can be used to split a string into a list.
• Nested list means a list within another list.

Question1:Write a program that creates a list of 10 random integers. Then create two lists by
name odd_list and even_list that have all odd and even values of the list respectively

Question2:Write a program to sort the elements in ascending order using selection sort.
Question3:Write a program that prints the maximum value of the second half of the list.
Question4:Write a program that creates a list of numbers 1–100 that are either divisible by
5 or 6.

Question5:Ask the user to enter three points and find whether they are collinear.
