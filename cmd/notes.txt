# Additional Information on SQL Joins

## Inner Join
**Purpose**: Selects records that have matching values in both tables.
**Syntax**:
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;


Summary of Behavior:
INNER JOIN: Intersection (only matching rows based on the condition).

LEFT JOIN: All rows from  A, with matched rows from ùêµB; unmatched rows in ùêµ B are filled with NULL.

Set A and Set B Analogy:
ùê¥‚à©ùêµ
A‚à©B: INNER JOIN
ùê¥+(ùê¥‚àíùêµ)
A+(A‚àíB): LEFT JOIN
