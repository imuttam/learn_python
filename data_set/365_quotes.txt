BONUS: HOW TO DISCOVER YOUR LIFE’S TRUE PURPOSE

Each of these activities will require you to use your imagination and to reflect deeply. Find a quiet, comfortable spot where you can close your eyes and think in peace. You may want to keep your journal or some paper nearby to record your thoughts.



ACTIVITY ONE: The Rocking Chair Test



It’s been said that when we are on our deathbeds we will regret the things we didn’t do, not the things we did. Imagine that you are 90 years old, fully retired and sitting in a rocking chair out on your porch. Imagine that you are looking back on your 90 years of life. What would be the things that would make you sad, if you never got around to doing them?

Are there places in the world that you would regret never having visited? Are there people in your life you still need to forgive, or to apologize to? Will you regret never having read the Bible, or never having learned to play the piano, or never having learned a foreign language? Who do you still need to thank? In what ways do you want to serve others before you retire?



ACTIVITY TWO: Lottery Winner



OK, if deathbed activities are too much of a downer, how about this one.

Congratulations, you won the (imaginary) lottery! How much? You decide. Pick an amount that is so huge, there is no way you’d ever have to work again. Pick an amount so big that you’d have money to spend at will. Ten million dollars? A hundred million? A billion? You pick.

Now truly imagine you won that much money. You can do anything you want to do! So what would you do? Sure, sure you’d buy sports cars and planes and vacation homes—what the heck, buy some islands. OK, you got all the toys out of the way, and still have so many years of your life to fill. What would you do? How would you spend your time?

Would you write a book? If so, on what topic? Would you still want to start a business even though you didn’t need the money? Is there a special charity you’d like to support, or maybe even start. Who would you want to help with your money? Family and friends are probably on your list, but who else comes to mind? Homeless veterans? Orphans? Abandoned pets?



ACTIVITY THREE: What Gives You Energy?

Isn’t it funny how time can move so slowly when we’re in a long boring meeting at work, or waiting in the dentist’s chair? And yet other times you’ve probably experienced states of “flow” where the hours just fly by and you can’t believe what time it is.

Try to remember the times and experiences that have flown by and given you energy—times when your work or play may have been challenging, but totally engaging. Do you get energy when you are alone, or with other people? Are your flow states typically when you are working with your hands, or working more cerebrally? Do you get lost (in a good way) figuring out the details of projects, or thinking of big picture vision? Are you a creator—do you like to create things whether they are books, businesses, or artwork?



Now it’s time to put it all together. Take the clues that come from imaging regrets, passions, flow-states and the types of people you like to serve. Put it all together to specifically answer:

What are the things you most like doing?

Who do you want to serve?

How might you benefit them?





There is no “right” way to write your purpose statement, but you might find inspiration from some of these specific examples:

“My purpose is to teach entrepreneurship to those in less developed countries so they, and future generations, can live a more prosperous life.”

“My purpose is to model positive values and healthy living for my children, so they might adopt healthy and happy lifestyles as adults.”



“My purpose is to create unique smartphone games for people who want to experience more joy in their life.”

“My purpose is to be a role-model of servant leadership so working professionals can maximize their engagement and productivity at work.”





Working on your personal purpose statement—or mission statement—can bring you both greater inner peace, and more daily motivation knowing you are serving your ultimate purpose.

And don’t forget, your purpose can change. As you live, you grow. You will have new experiences, new relationships, new learnings that will impact. Don’t be afraid to grow your purpose along the way.
